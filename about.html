		<article id="me"> My name is Sean Jackson. I am a healthcare worker and career changer. Prior to the pandemic,
		I bridged to a bachelors of commerce at Ontario Tech university from Durham College to educate myself further and progress my career.<br> 

		<br>After one semester, we had the lockdown partially through the second semester. Fortunately, I kept myself busy between work and school. I applied into to a business technology management and I was accepted. While I did well in my business courses, my grades were much better in my IT courses. I was naive thinking about a pivoting from a general business degree. The pandemic taught me that this was a complete career change.

		Last summer, I decided to apply into the Technology Management bachelors of IT. I looking forward to graduating and entering the tech world ASAP.
